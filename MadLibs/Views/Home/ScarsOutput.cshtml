<h1>Hello From Afar</h1>
<p>Dear @Model.GetRecipient(),</p>
<p>How are you? I hope that you are having a nice weekend. I'm vacationing in the Iceland while I learn programming! </p>
<p>@Model.GetRecipient(), you would not believe how cold it is here. I should have gone to Hawaii instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

Wanna know how I got these scars???........My father was a @Model.GetWord("drinker")....and a fiend..... So one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the @Model.GetWord("knife") to @Model.GetWord("defend")....He doesn't like that. Not....one....bit.....So,... me watching, he takes the @Model.GetWord("knife") to her, laughing while he does it. He looks at me.... and he says "@Model.GetWord("serious") !"....He comes at me with the @Model.GetWord("knife")......"@Model.GetWord("serious")!!"..."Let's put a smile on that face!!"......And......(looks at other gangster) @Model.GetWord("serious")
